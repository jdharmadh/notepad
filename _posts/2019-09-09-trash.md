Let's build an autocomplete! The first thing we're going to need are some words and data about how important they are. I used an [English word frequency dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/english-word-frequency) from Kaggle; the number of times a word appears in an English approximation is a good first approximation of which words might be relevant to the user.

Now we start a new project:
`cargo init autocomplete`
