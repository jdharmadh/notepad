Let's build Google Maps from scratch. First, we need some data.

I use this the [OpenStreetMap](https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/washington.html) dataset which has high-quality data about road networks. It's in a `.pbf` file format (a protobuf-based compression format similar to `gzip`), so the first thing we need to do is to use the [osmium](https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/) tool to convert it into a `.osm` . 
`osmium cat washington-250830.osm.pbf -o washington.osm`

Hello $\sum x = y$ is correct

$$E = mc^2$$
